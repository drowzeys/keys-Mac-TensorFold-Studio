# Build and push the GHCR carrier image, one for both builds: for a Mac the TensorFold wheel at the pinned commit, the
# dependency lock, the render scripts and the native Metal engine; for a DGX Spark the prebuilt CUDA engine
# (payload/spark-engine, copied from $PREFIX/tf-h3 on a Spark where spark/build-engine.sh has run).
#   bash scripts/build-carrier.sh           # build only
#   PUSH=1 bash scripts/build-carrier.sh    # build + push (needs `docker login ghcr.io` with write:packages)
# The wheel is pure Python, so the carrier can be built on any machine with Docker and python3. The native engine
# is not: build it on a Mac with scripts/build-zig-engine.sh and copy payload/zig-engine here first; without it the
# carrier is built without the engine and oneshot-setup.sh builds from source or stays on the MLX engine.
